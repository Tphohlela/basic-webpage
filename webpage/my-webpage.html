                    Seoul is the capital city of South Korea, one of the top tech countries in the world. This tech also
                    impacts the daily lives of South Koreans through their transport system and the way they shop making
                    both experiences enjoyable and efficient. Despite this, the city has been able to keep some
                    traditional
                    Korean architecture. The way Seoul is able to balance staying true to it's identity whilst elevating
                    it's technology is way too cool. I really want to visit one day.

                It's one of the most spoken languages in Africa so I think it would make my travels in Africa easier if
                I spoke it plus it's just a beautiful language.
